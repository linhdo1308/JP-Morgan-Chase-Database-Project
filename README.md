# JP Morgan Chase Database Project (SQL)
Our team analyzed JP Morgan Chaseâ€™s business requirements to modernize and streamline their financial services. Based on these needs, we designed and developed a comprehensive PostgreSQL database to efficiently store, manage, and track transactional and customer data for the bank. The system supports core banking functionalities such as customer information management, transaction tracking, loan management, financial product management, and AI-driven financial recommendations.

To structure the database effectively, we created a conceptual model outlining key entities and relationships within the system. This was followed by a logical model defining data attributes, data types, and constraints for each entity. Finally, we developed a physical model optimized for PostgreSQL implementation, focusing on data integrity, security, and scalability. This end-to-end database solution provides a robust foundation for Chase to manage their operations and leverage data-driven insights for improved customer services.
